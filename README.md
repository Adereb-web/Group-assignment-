# Age Calculator App - Group 1 Solution

This is the solution of the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q) by Group 1 during Cohort 8 at [HerTechTrail](https://www.hertechtrail.org). It is a challenge from Frontend Mentor. <br>
This is an Age Calculator app that gives the user the ability to calculate their age with ease. It gives the user information on the number of year, month and days by just inserting his/her birth date. Any invalid date will throw an error slightly below the input fields.

## Overview

### The Assignment

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form

  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Dark Mode and light Mode, with a toggle to switch between modes
- Stores Age in local storage
